# Requirements summary for certificates
This document attempts to summarize the requirements for various kinds of X.509
certificates.

Please note that **the OpenSSL configuration files I provide do not encode all
requirements listed here**. In some cases, the syntax is not sufficiently
expressive: this is the case with some DN requirements for Extended Validation
certificates (where certain fields may be present only if others are). Other
requirements, such as those related to validation procedures, can not be
encoded in a configuration file at all; it is up to you to make sure they are
followed. I will also focus on fields that will need to be set manually,
especially in the case of RFC 5280-related ones (requirements which are
automatically taken care of by OpenSSL will be omitted) and will omit
less-common situations (such as LDAP CRLs for public CAs).

## Common requirements
These requirements apply to all profiles listed in the rest of this document.

* Certificates MUST be X.509v3 ones (BR, section 7.1.1; RFC5246, section
  7.4.2, for Web servers; AATL, requirement 2, for PDF signing certificates;
  MTRPR, section 4.A.1, for root certificates)
* The certificate serial number MUST be a unique, positive, non-sequential
  integer, at most 20 octets long, containing at least 64 bits of output from a
  CSPRNG (RFC 5280, section 4.1.2.2; BR, section 7.1; CS, section 9.6; MSRP,
  section 5.2)
* The certificate signing algorithm should be one of those listed in RFC 3279
  or its updates (RFC 4055, RFC 4491, RFC 5480, RFC 5756, RFC 5758) for maximum
  compatibility (each software implementation that conforms to RFC5280 MUST
  support them); other algorithms can be used (RFC 5280, section 4.1.2.3)
* The Issuer field MUST contain a non-empty Distinguished Name and it MUST be
  encoded as an `UTF8String` or as a `printableString` (RFC 5280, section
  4.1.2.4)
* The Subject Distinguished Name MUST be unique for each physical subject (note
  that this still allows issuing multiple certificates with the same DN to the
  same subject; RFC 5280, section 4.1.2.6)
* E-mail addresses MUST be encoded as `rfc822Name`s in the Subject Alternative
  Name extension. Putting them in the `E` component of the Subject Distinguished
  Name is deprecated; if that component is present, the e-mail address MUST be
  encoded as an `IA5String` and be at most 255 characters long (RFC 5280,
  section 4.1.2.6, and RFC 5750, sections 3 and 4.4.3)
* The algorithm and method used to encode the public key and to identify the
  algorithm with which the key is used MUST be chosen among the ones listed in
  RFC 3279 or its updates (RFC 4055, RFC 4491, RFC 5480, RFC 5756, RFC 5758)
  (RFC 5280, section 4.1.2.7)
* The Authority Key Identifier extension MUST be present (it MAY be omitted in
  root CAs) and MUST be non-critical; it is recommended to derive it from the
  authority public key instead of the issuer name and serial number (RFC 5280,
  section 4.2.1.1)
* The Subject Key Identifier extension MUST be present in CA certificates and
  SHOULD be present in end entity certificates. It MUST be non-critical
  (RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.2)
* The Key Usage extension MUST be present if the certificate is used to
  validate signatures; it SHOULD be critical. The usage bits MUST be consistent
  with the key usage purposes:

    Key usage bit      | Usage
    -------------------|------
    `digitalSignature` | The public key is used to verify signatures other than those on certificates and CRLs
    `nonRepudiation`   | The digital signatures made using the key (not on certificates/CRLs) can not be denied
    `keyEncipherment`  | The public key is used to encipher private or secret keys (e.g. symmetric session keys in TLS)
    `dataEncipherment` | The public key is used to encipher data directly
    `keyAgreement`     | The public key is used for key agreement
    `keyCertSign`      | The public key is used to verify signatures on public key certificates (this requires `CA:TRUE` in the Basic Constraints extension, see below)
    `cRLSign`          | The public key is used to verify signatures on CRLs
    `encipherOnly`     | If `keyAgreement` is set, the public key may be used only for enciphering data while performing key agreement
    `decipherOnly`     | If `keyAgreement` is set, the public key may be used only for deciphering data while performing key agreement

    as well as with the certificate and key type:

    Key type    | Certificate type | Permissible key usage bits
    ------------|------------------|---------------------------
    RSA         | CA/CRL issuer    | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`, `keyEncipherment` (SHOULD NOT be present), `dataEncipherment` (SHOULD NOT be present), `keyCertSign`, `cRLSign`
    RSA         | End entity       | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`, `keyEncipherment`, `dataEncipherment`
    DSA         | CA/CRL issuer    | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`, `keyCertSign`, `cRLSign`
    DSA         | End entity       | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`
    DH-KEK      | All              | `keyAgreement`, `encipherOnly`, `decipherOnly`
    KEA         | All              | `keyAgreement`, `encipherOnly`, `decipherOnly`
    ECDSA/ECDH  | CA/CRL issuer    | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`, `keyAgreement`, `encipherOnly`, `decipherOnly`, `keyCertSign`, `cRLSign`
    ECDSA/ECDH  | End entity       | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`, `keyAgreement`, `encipherOnly`, `decipherOnly`
    ECPublicKey | CA/CRL issuer    | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`, `keyAgreement`, `encipherOnly`, `decipherOnly`, `keyCertSign`, `cRLSign`
    ECPublicKey | End entity       | `digitalSignature`, `nonRepudiation`, `keyAgreement`, `encipherOnly`, `decipherOnly`
    ecDH/ecMQV  | End entity       | `keyAgreement`, `encipherOnly`, `decipherOnly`

    (`encipherOnly`/`decipherOnly` can be present only if `keyAgreement` is set
    and MUST NOT be present at the same time) (RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.3; RFC
    3279, sections 2.3.1-2.3.5)

* Certificate policies MUST consist of one or more OIDs, each of which MUST
  appear only once, and of some optional qualifiers. The `userNotice` field
  SHOULD appear only in CA certificates issued to third parties and in end
  entity certificates; the `noticeRef` field SHOULD NOT be present; the
  `explicitText` MUST be at most 200 characters long, SHOULD be encoded as an
  `UTF8String` and it SHOULD NOT include control characters (RFC 5280, section
  4.2.1.4)
* Policy mappings MUST be used only in CA certificates; if the extension is
  present, it SHOULD be critical. Each `issuerDomainPolicy` should also be
  asserted in a certificate policy in the same certificate. No mappings to/from
  `anyPolicy` are allowed (RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.5)
* The Subject Alternative Name extension MUST be used to bind DNS/e-mail
  resources. If the only subject identity is an alternative name, the extension
  MUST be critical; it SHOULD be non-critical otherwise (RFC 5280, section
  4.2.1.6)
* The Issuer Alternative Name extension SHOULD be non-critical (RFC 5280,
  section 4.2.1.7)
* The Subject Directory Attributes extension MUST be non-critical (RFC 5280,
  section 4.2.1.8)
* The Basic Constraints extension MUST be present and MUST be critical in CA
  certificates (with the exception of CA certificates used exclusively for
  purposes other than validating digital signatures on certificates); it MAY
  be present in end entity certificates. If `CA` is `FALSE`, the `keyCertSign`
  bit in the Key Usage extension MUST NOT be asserted (RFC 5280, section
  4.2.1.9; RFC 5750, section 4.4.1)
* The Name Constraints extension MUST be present only in CA certificates and
  MUST be critical; constraints MUST NOT be imposed on `x400Addresses`,
  `ediPartyNames` or `registeredIDs`; the list of constraints MUST NOT be empty
  (RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.10)
* The Policy Constraints extension can be used only in sub-CA certificates;
  it MUST be critical (RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.11)
* The Extended Key Usage values MUST be consistent with the bits enabled in the
  Key Usage extension. If the `anyExtendedKeyUsage` value is present, the
  extension SHOULD NOT be marked as critical, otherwise, it MAY be critical or
  non-critical (RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.12)
* No Extended Key Usage values that do not apply in the context of the public
  Internet (with limited exceptions) or that will mislead the public about the
  information verified by the CA (BR, section 7.1.2.4)
* In the CRL Distribution Point extension, the URIs using the HTTP scheme
  MUST point to a DER-encoded CRL served with the MIME type
  `application/pkix-crl` (RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.13).
* If the Inhibit anyPolicy extension is present, it MUST be critical (RFC 5280,
  section 4.2.1.14)
* If the Freshest CRL extension is present, it MUST be non-critical (RFC 5280,
  section 4.2.1.15)
* If the Authority Information Access extension is present, it MUST be
  non-critical; if the `id-ad-caIssuers` access method is present and the CA
  certificate is provided as a single DER certificate over HTTP, the MIME type
  with which the certificate is served should be `application/pkix-cert`; if
  the `id-ad-ocsp method` is present, the URI should point to an OCSP responder
  conformant to RFC 2560 (now obsoleted by RFC 6960) (RFC 5280, section 4.2.21,
  and RFC 6960, section 3.1)
* If the Subject Information Access extension is present, it MUST be
  non-critical. The `id-ad-timeStamping` OID can be used to specify the
  location of a time stamping server provided by the CA: in that case, the
  location MUST be an HTTP/FTP URI or an e-mail address (RFC 5280, section
  4.2.2.2)
* If Certificate Transparency precertificates are to be included in the final
  certificate, the CA must first create a certificate that is identical to the
  one to be signed, except for the addition of an extension having
  `1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.3` as its OID and ASN.1 `NULL` data as its value; it
  must be signed either with the CA key or with an auxiliary certificate
  (*Precertificate Signing Certificate*) having the following profile:

    * Basic Constraints: `CA:TRUE`;
    * Extended Key Usage: Certificate Transparency (OID
      `1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.4`)

    The timestamp list returned by the Certificate Transparency server should
    be then encoded as an ASN.1 octet string and inserted as a certificate
    extension with OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.2` (RFC 6962, sections 3.1 and
    3.3)

* CAs MUST reject certificate requests having a known weak private key or not
  meeting the digest algorithm/key size requirements for each profile (BR,
  section 6.1.1.3; CS, section 9.5)
* The digest algorithm used MUST be SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512 (BR, sections
  6.1.5 and 7.1.3; AATL, requirement 9; CS, appendix A; MSRP, section 5.1;
  MTRPR, section 4.B)
* For RSA certificates, the minimum modulus size MUST be 2048 bits and MUST be
  divisible by 8; in the case of code signing/time stamping certificates and CA
  chains, the minimum modulus size MUST be 4096 bits (BR, section 6.1.5; AATL,
  requirement 9; CS, appendix A; MSRP, section 5.1; MTRPR, section 4.B)
* For ECC certificates, the certificate MUST use one of the following NIST
  curves: P-256 with SHA-256 or P-384 with SHA-384. (BR, section 6.1.5; AATL,
  requirement 9, mandates "at least P-256"; CS, appendix A; MSRP, section 5.1;
  MTRPR, section 4.B)
* For DSA certificates, the minimum modulus size MUST be 2048 bits and the
  minimum divisor size MUST be 224 or 256 bits (BR, section 6.1.5; CS, appendix
  A)
* CAs MUST NOT issue certificates having ASN.1 decoding errors, invalid public
  keys, duplicate issuer names and serial numbers (with the exception of
  Certificate Transparency precertificates), incorrect extensions, CRL
  Distribution Points or OCSP responder URLs for which no operational service
  exists (MSRP, section 5.2)

## Root CA
* Root CA keys MUST be used to sign only:

    * the root CA certificate;
    * certificates for subordinate CAs;
    * cross certificates;
    * certificate for infrastructure purposes (e.g. OCSP responder certificates);
    * certificate issued solely for the purpose of testing products with
      certificates issued by a root CA

    (BR, section 6.1.7; CS, section 12)

* The certificate subject MUST contain the `countryName` and the
  `organizationName` fields; the `commonName` SHOULD be present (BR, section
  7.1.2.1; MCARR, section "Contents of the Root")
* The CA name MUST be meaningful, MUST identify the publisher, MUST be unique
  and MUST be in a language appropriate for the CA market and readable by a
  typical customer in that market (AATL, requirement 3; MTRPR, section 4.A.1)
* The key pair MUST be generated and stored on a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or
  equivalent HSM (AATL, requirement 6)
* The root CA validity should range from 8 to 25 years (MTRPR, section 4.A.2-3)
* Private keys and subject names MUST be unique per root certificate (MTRPR,
  section 4.A.6)
* The Basic Constraints extension MUST be present, critical and set to
  `CA:TRUE`; `pathLenConstraint` SHOULD NOT be present (BR, section 7.1.2.1;
  MTRPR, section 4.A.1)

* The Certificate Policies extension SHOULD NOT be present (BR, sections
  7.1.2.1 and 7.1.6.2; CS, section 9.3.2)
* The Extended Key Usage extension MUST NOT be present (BR, section 7.1.2.1)
* The Subject Alternative Name MAY contain a support contact e-mail address
  (MCARR, section "Contents of the Root")

## Common requirements for intermediate CA certificates
* Separate intermediate CAs MUST be used for Web server, S/MIME, code signing
  and time stamping certificates (MTRPR, section 4.A.11)
* The CA name MUST be meaningful (AATL, requirement 3)
* The certificate subject MUST contain the `countryName` and the
  `organizationName` fields (BR, section 7.1.2.2)
* The key pair MUST be generated and stored on a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or
  equivalent HSM (AATL, requirement 6)
* The Certificate Policies extension MUST be present and SHOULD NOT be marked
  critical. The policy identifier is required. If the subordinate CA is not
  affiliated with the entity that controls the root CA, the policy qualifier ID
  MUST contain an explicit policy identifier indicating the subordinate CA
  adherence to and compliance with the Baseline Requirements (either a
  CA/Browser Forum reserved identifier or a CA-specific OID), MUST NOT contain
  `anyPolicy` and the policy qualifier ID MAY be set to `id-qt 1`; otherwise, it
  MAY contain an explicit policy identifier and/or `anyPolicy` (in the case of
  code signing certificates, it MUST contain the CA/Browser Forum reserved
  identifier for code signing and MAY include the `anyPolicy` identifier). The
  CPS URI MAY (MUST in the case of CAs issuing code signing/time stamping
  certificates where the subordinate CA is not affiliated with the root CA) be
  set to the HTTP URL for the CPS (BR, sections 7.1.2.2 and 7.1.6.3; CS,
  section 9.3.3 and appendix B)
* The CRL Distribution Points extension MUST be present, MUST be non-critical
  and it MUST point to the HTTP URL for the CRL service (BR, section 7.1.2.2;
  AATL, requirement 17; CS, appendix B; MTRPR, section 4.C.4)
* The Authority Information Access extension MUST be present, MUST be
  non-critical and MUST contain the HTTP URL for the OCSP responder (unless the
  certificate subject staples the OCSP response in its TLS handshakes); it
  SHOULD also contain the HTTP URL at which the issuing CA certificate can be
  retrieved (BR, section 7.1.2.2; AATL, requirement 17; CS, appendix B;
  MTRPR, section 4.C.4)
* The Basic Constraints extension MUST be present, critical and set to
  `CA:TRUE`; `pathLenConstraint` MAY be present (BR, section 7.1.2.2; CS,
  appendix B)
* The Key Usage extension MUST be present and critical. `keyCertSign` and
  `cRLSign` MUST be set; if the certificate is used to sign OCSP responses,
  `digitalSignature` MUST be set (BR, section 7.1.2.2; CS, appendix B)
* The Name Constraints extension, if present, SHOULD be critical (BR, section
  7.1.2.2)
* If the subordinate CA certificate should be technically constrained, the
  Name Constraints extension MUST be present; `permittedSubtrees` MUST contain
  the DNS names/IP addresses over which the subordinate CA applicants have
  control and the directory name (if any). If the subordinate CA is not allowed
  to issue certificates to IP addresses, the entire IPv4 and IPv6 ranges MUST
  be listed in `excludedSubtrees` (respectively, as `0.0.0.0/0` and as `::0/0`);
  otherwise, at least one IP address MUST be present; similarly, if the CA is
  not allowed to issue certificates to DNS names, a zero length DNS name MUST
  be listed in `excludedSubtrees`, otherwise, at least one name MUST be listed
  in `permittedSubtrees` (BR, section 7.1.5)
* Government Web server CAs MUST be name constrained to `.gov` domains and may
  issue certificates only to the country codes the country has sovereign
  control over (MTRPR, section 4.A.8)
* The Extended Key Usage SHOULD be non-critical; if the subordinate CA
  certificate should be technically constrained, `id-kp-serverAuth`,
  `id-kp-clientAuth` or both MUST be present, and the `anyExtendedKeyUsage` ID
  MUST NOT appear. In case `id-kp-serverAuth` is present, the certificate must
  be name constrained; in case `id-kp-emailProtection` is present, all end
  entity certificates MUST only include e-mail addresses that the issuing CA has
  confirmed that the subordinate CA is authorized to use (BR, sections 7.1.2.2
  and 7.1.5; CS, appendix B; MSRP, section 5.3.1)

## Common requirements for end entity certificates
* End entity certificates MUST have a maximum validity period of 39 months
  (825 days if they are issued after March 1st, 2018 or if they are EV
  certificates); EV certificates SHOULD have a maximum validity period of 12
  months, and MUST have a maximum validity of 15 months if an `.onion` domain is
  included (BR, section 6.3.2; EV, section 9.4 and appendix F; CS, section 9.4)
* The Certificate Policies extension MUST be present and SHOULD NOT be critical;
  the policy identifier is required and MUST include one of the reserved
  CA/Browser Forum OIDs depending on the validation type; the policy identifier
  ID, if present, SHOULD be `id-qt 1` and the `cPSuri` SHOULD be the HTTP URI
  pointing to the subordinate CA CPS (BR, section 7.1.2.3; CS, section 9.3.4
  and appendix B; MTRPR, section 4.A.15)
* If the CRL Distribution Points extension is present, it MUST NOT be critical
  and it MUST contain the HTTP URL to the CA CRL (BR, section 7.1.2.3; CS,
  appendix B)
* The Authority Information Access extension MUST be present and MUST NOT be
  critical; it MUST contain the HTTP URL of the OCSP responder for the CA
  (except when the CA mandates subscribers to perform OCSP stapling) and
  SHOULD contain the HTTP URL to the issuing CA certificate (mandatory for code
  signing/time stamping certificates) (BR, section 7.1.2.3; AATL, requirement
  17; CS, appendix B; MTRPR, section 4.A.5, mandates OCSP for Web server
  certificates and OCSP or a CRL for other certificates)
* In the Basic Constraints extension, the CA field MUST be `FALSE` and the
  `pathLenConstraint` field MUST be absent (BR, section 7.1.2.3; CS, appendix B;
  MTRPR, section 4.A.16)
* If the Key Usage extension is present, the bits `keyCertSign` and `cRLSign`
  MUST NOT be set (BR, section 7.1.2.3)
* The Extended Key Usage field MUST be include at least one of
  `id-kp-serverAuth` or `id-kp-clientAuth`; `id-kp-emailProtection` MAY be
  present; `anyExtendedKeyUsage` MUST NOT be present; other values SHOULD NOT
  be present (BR, section 7.1.2.3, overridden by some more specific certificate
  profiles; MTRPR, section 4.A.18)
* The Subject Alternative Name MUST be present, MUST contain at least one domain
  entry, each of which MUST be either a dNSName containing an FQDN or an
  `iPAddress` containing the IP address of a server; wildcard FQDNs are
  permitted, reserved IP addresses and internal names are prohibited (BR,
  section 7.1.4.2.1)
* The Subject Distinguished Name `commonName` field is optional (it is
  deprecated); if it is present, it MUST contain a single IP address or FQDN
  among those listed in the Subject Alternative Name extension (BR, section
  7.1.4.2.2)
* The Subject Distinguished Name `organizationName` field is prohibited if the
  "domain validated" policy OID is present or if the "individual validated"
  policy OID is present and the `givenName` and `surname` fields are present,
  mandatory if the "organization validated" policy OID is present, or if the
  "individual validated" policy OID is present and the `givenName` and `surname`
  fields are absent, optional otherwise; if it is present, it MUST contain the
  certificate subject name/DBA. It MAY also be used to convey a natural
  person's subject name or DBA (BR, sections 7.1.4.2.2 and 7.1.6.1)

* If a dedicated certificate is used, it MUST include a non-critical extension
  "id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck" with a `NULL` value (to specify that no revocation
  checking should be performed on that certificate); for this reason, in this
  case, the certificate lifetime should be short (RFC 6960, section 4.2.2.2.1,
  and BR, section 4.9.9)
